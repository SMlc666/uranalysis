Project uranayzle (C++20, xmake). Structure: engine library + clients (cli, imgui). Docs in docs/: OVERVIEW/ARCHITECTURE/ROADMAP/TECH_STACK. Engine API: get_engine_info. ELF loader supports ELF64 little-endian, reads program headers + section headers (names via shstrtab), loads PT_LOAD segments into LoadedImage for vaddr reads. CLI prints ELF info, PH/SH lists, and disassembles ARM64 at entry using Capstone (0x100 bytes, 20 insns). ImGui client set up for Win32 + DX11/DX12 using xmake imgui package (xmake-repo), selectable via --imgui_backend. Windows build only for imgui_client. Files: xmake.lua, src/engine/loader/elf_loader.cpp, src/engine/core/image.cpp, src/engine/disasm/arm64_disasm.cpp, headers in src/engine/include/engine/*.h, clients/cli/main.cpp, clients/imgui/win32_dx11.cpp & win32_dx12.cpp.
Updates: Engine Session wrapper added (src/engine/include/engine/session.h, src/engine/core/session.cpp); clients now use engine::Session. LLIR added: header src/engine/include/engine/llir.h (namespace engine::llir) and implementation src/engine/ir/llir/llir.cpp with ARM64 CFG builder; old il0 files removed. engine::Session now exposes LLIR CFG build API (build_llir_cfg_arm64). Function discovery moved to analysis (engine/function_discovery.h + analysis/function_discovery.cpp) with FunctionDiscoveryOptions; Session wrapper discover_llir_functions_arm64 now calls analysis layer. Added symbol parsing in ELF loader (ElfSymbol + load_elf_image_with_symbols) and stored symbols in Session; analysis entry-point strategies now include symbol entries and tail-jump targets (separate analysis files). Typeinfo detection now parses real ABI `type_info` objects (vtable pointer + name) and RttiCatalog scans vtables in `.rodata`/`.data.rel.ro`, making rich RTTI/vtable data accessible along with symbols/RTTI/DWARF metadata.
